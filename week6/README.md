# simple_ubuntu_fetcher.py README

## Overview

**simple_ubuntu_fetcher.py** is a Python script inspired by the Ubuntu philosophy of "I am because we are." It allows users to respectfully fetch and organize images from the global internet community, handling errors gracefully and supporting collective sharing and appreciation of digital resources.[1][3]

## Features

- Prompts for a URL containing an image.
- Connects to the internet to download shared resources.
- Creates a directory called `Fetched_Images` if it doesn't exist.
- Extracts a filename from the image URL or generates a unique name.
- Saves the image in binary mode.
- Handles HTTP errors and exceptions gracefully, providing user-friendly messages.

## Ubuntu Principles

- **Community**: Connects to the wider web community to fetch shared resources.
- **Respect**: Handles errors gracefully, respecting connectivity and permissions.
